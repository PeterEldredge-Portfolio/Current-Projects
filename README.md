Information on my current projects, including my upcoming full release PC game, The Poisoned Roots.

### The Poisoned Roots / Artificial Absurdity: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435560/The_Poisoned_Roots/

The Poisoned Roots is a narrative driven game about abuse, obsession, and the dark secrets of a troubled American home. Itâ€™s a short game, and 
is intended to be played in a single sitting. It is the culmination of a few years of experimenting with narrative driven games, and the systems
that I created for them. There were a lot of failed projects leading up to this one, but we are confident that it will be completed with a level
of polish we are satisfied with in early 2021.

The gameplay is simple, you walk around an environment, looking for clues and items that can piece together what happened. There are a few puzzles,
as well as some surprises in how the game unfolds. I am the Lead Programmer on the project, as well as the Co-Founder of the company that we formed
to release the game as, Artificial Absutdity LLC. Going through the process of forming the company and releasing the game on steam has really
helped me understand the process of making games a truly wholistic sense, and I've really enoyed it.

As mentioned, it was built off the back of several projects that were cancelled for a variety of reasons. I have a few video demos of those projects
to share.

Many of the art assets used in the game came from purchased asset packs, as well as things like post processig affects and volumetric lighting. In
the gameplay and implementation of the systems and effects have been done almost entirely by me, including some additional tools such as one to help
capture trailer footage.
